1. The "Memorization" Interaction
Since you have a toggleHifz() button, you need the logic to support it. Instead of just blurring, use the Spacebar to reveal verses one by one.

Logic: When Hifz Mode is active, hide all .translation divs and set all .arabic divs to opacity: 0.

Action: Every time the user hits the spacebar, find the currentLocalIndex, reveal that verse, and scroll it into view.

2. Local Storage Sync (The "Resume" Feature)
Users rarely finish a Surah in one sitting. You can make the app feel "intelligent" by saving the last-read verse.

Logic: Inside prepVerse(), add localStorage.setItem('lastRead', JSON.stringify({s: surahId, a: index})).

Action: On the home screen, add a "Resume" button that pulls this data and triggers Sanctuary.navigateSurah().

3. Keyboard Shortcuts
For a desktop experience, adding global listeners makes navigation lightning-fast:

Space: Play/Pause Audio.

ArrowRight: Next Ayah.

ArrowLeft: Previous Ayah.

M: Toggle Hifz Mode.

A Small CSS Fix
In your current code, the Lucide Icons might disappear if you don't re-run lucide.createIcons() after rendering new HTML (like the Surah cards or Verses).

Strategy: Create a small helper function like updateUI() that you call at the end of renderHome and renderVerses. It should look like this:

JavaScript
updateUI() {
  lucide.createIcons();
  // Any other UI refreshes go here
}
